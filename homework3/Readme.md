### Word Sense Disambiguity
<br/>
Abstract
-----------------------
In this assignment, we need to use machine learning technique to do the word sense disambiguity task. At the part A, we collect the words in the windows and regard them as the training data. Next, we format each window's words as the feature of each lexicon. Finally, we use linear SVM and K-nearest neighborhood algorithm to train the classifier. In part B, we try to improve the performance of the WSD system. In this implementation, I just remove the words which are neither alphabetic nor numeric.       
<br/>
Usage    
-----------------------
1. Get the training data and testing data: ```unzip data.zip```
2. Train and get the result: ```./run.sh```
3. see the result in console: ```./evaluate.sh```
